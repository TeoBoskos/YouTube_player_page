# YouTube Player Page using HTML and CSS.

This was my first ever project regarding coding. After I finished a course on HTML and CSS that I bought,
I decided to practice and made this. However, since there is no JavaScript code, nothing in there has
some functionality. It's just HTML and CSS. It is a YouTube player page clone, with a video player, a bar
with videos, some comments, etc.

# Found any bugs?

So know that the project may have multiple bugs that I might not have noticed, because I was a complete
beginner on coding when I made this. I am open to any criticism that is going to help me improve my skills.
